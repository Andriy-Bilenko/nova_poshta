# nova_poshta
## About the program
It is a C++ programming lab work #6 for Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv, Faculty of Radiophysics, Electronics and Computer Systems. The main goal is the manual creation and realization of queue data structure of "nova poshta's packages". Queue is designed as a singly-linked list.

Program built with Qt 6.5.0 on Windows 11 64-bit, and is designed exlusively for this operating system.

## Usage
Just install it with fairly easy installation wizard from `nova_poshta_1_1_setup.exe` and it is ready to do its work. Load data from `data_from_file_for_nova_poshta.txt` to the queue.
To uninstall the program open the file browser and find `PATH\WHERE\YOU\INSTALLED\nova_poshta_1_1\uninstall.exe`.

## Flaws of the program:
- Loading data from one file multiple times will cause duplicates, feature is intended to be used only once.
- may be prone to various bugs (for example corrupted data in a file), as it was made way too fast to include all the checks needed.
- uses functions of type "on_x_button_clicked()" instead of connecting all the internals appropriately.

## Additional info:
- `informal_report_UA.docx` includes some code explanations in ukrainian. It's not a formal document as a matter of fact.
